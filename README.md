## What is Atomic Design?

Popularly known within the design world, Atomic Design helps to build
consistent, solid and reusable design systems

## StoryBook

Development faster and easier by isolating components.

### `npm run storybook`

<br>

Wait until default browser Open or you can click on
[http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) when webpack finished.

## Typescript

TypeScript is a superset of typed JavaScript (optional) that can help build and
manage large-scale JavaScript projects. It can be considered JavaScript with
additional features like strong static typing, compilation, and object-oriented
programming.

## Styled-component (CSS-in-JS / styling)

[**Read full article**](https://blog.logrocket.com/benefits-using-styled-components-react/)

As CSS-in-JS is essentially JavaScript code, you can apply complex logic to your
style rules, such as loops, conditionals, variables, state-based styling, and
more. Therefore, it’s an ideal solution if you need to create a complicated UI
that requires dynamic functionality

# Testing

### `npm run test`

# Available Scripts

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best
performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can
`eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from
your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive
dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have
full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but
they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point
you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for
small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this
feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.
